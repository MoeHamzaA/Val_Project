I sit in the stillness, heart swelling with thoughts of you.

Oh, how do I find words vast enough to hold the way I love you?
Words tremble beneath the weight of your meaning, your essence,
And yet, my love tries—because it must.

You are the sun that warms my world,
The moon that soothes my restless nights,
The stars that guide me when I feel lost.
You are my home in a world that never stops moving.

Your laughter—oh, your laughter—
It is music to a silence I never realized consumed me.
And your voice—gentle, steady—
Holds me like the earth holds the sea,
Balancing chaos with calm.

Every moment with you feels infinite.
The seconds stretch, sweet and slow,
As if even time itself knows to savor you.
The way your hand fits mine,
The way your smile pulls me closer,
The way your love fills every empty corner of me—
These are my treasures.

You are the reason my heart beats steady,
And the reason it skips at times, too.
You are the calm in my storms,
The light I follow through the fog.

You, my love, are everything.
You are the promise of tomorrow,
The joy of my today,
And the echo of every hope I’ve ever held close.

If I could, I’d show you how much you mean to me—
With the vastness of the oceans,
With the height of the heavens,
With the infinite sparkle of every star.

But even they fall short,
Because you, my love, are the only measure of how much I love you.
It’s endless. Boundless.
Forever.

You are my always, my everything.
And I will carry your heart in mine,
For as long as the stars shine above us.
